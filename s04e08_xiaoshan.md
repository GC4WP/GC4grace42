At first,I read this book,then,I knew the book of The River,
and knew her husband of He Wei,and finally I knew than the writer of He Wei's wife .

He Wei also wrote villagers in The River, writing about their rustic enthusiasm and kindness to others.
And his wife write other villagers,their are girls of eace one 16 years,and come from the mountain.
But they live their village for works to Dongguan.
AT first,they stay work in different of factory,and work hard ,
and soon later,some of them some became clerks, some became salesmen, 
and some still struggled on the assembly line. Every girl want to change life.
So some of one learn English, learn sales, learn lectures ...and adapt to society.
I read this book,and at first accept struggling and vigorous, upward vitality, fresh power rising in the land.
