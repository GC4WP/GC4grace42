> write and type


when I type, my think with the typewriter only split by keyboard, and with the same key size and position ... etc, I can forget how to type, just let muscle auto working, weverythn will good enough for export my mind.

but this just for English writing, if i back Chinese writing, the word type unto screen, is not only with keyboar, there must need another huy help:

    IME ~ input method environment

means:
I type with keyboar is not diaplay in scree, an first IME got them, and generation choice list og Chiense word, so I had to pick one, then the background system put it unto screen.

this process break my Chinese imagination:

Every one Chinese word merged more 3 level means:

    0: chape like litter paint, talk about one seanson
    1: voice with speak feeling with other emontions
    2: means base the high levels

all these multi-means make up every one Chinese word, and this style alaso embdded into process order for write Chinese words, every word write by hand just like draw one tiny picture, so different with type just click keyboard.

so because, writing is movie from thinking , but thinking base language, that meand when I write Chinese words, write on paper with pancile, is very different type onto screen under IME helpping.

type block my Chinese soul, handwriting in paper is the best way for Chinese writing.

so the next problem is:

    hoew to make writing keep Chinese soul,
    but also can easy transform into computer for quckly sharing?
